## ROAMM ??

```
This is the 4th and **final** re-write of a side project I've been working on for a year +
I'm currently in my final semester at aptech, studying software engineering.
```

### BACKGROUND

I spent a lot of months letting this idea marinate and I know you're
not supposed to make B2C social apps that have no significant
differentiator as it is a quite frankly a waste of time.

#### I've quit several times

I'm building this to develop a character trait of finishing what i
start. If it flops, good. If it succeeds, also good.

## ENDGAME

This app hopes to bring you closer to real experiences in the real
world. Helping you find obscure gems in your dense, complex city to do
stuff, meet people, and have stories to tell. I also want people to
share what sights and sounds they are exploring and what it means to
them.

_The World is always Beautiful. If you blink too long, you'll miss
it._
