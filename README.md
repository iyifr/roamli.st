## BACKGROUND

This is the 4th and **final** re-write of a side project I've been
working on for a year + I'm currently in my final semester at aptech,
studying software engineering. I spent a lot of months letting this
idea marinate and I know you're not supposed to make B2C social apps
that have no significant differentiator as it is a quite frankly a
waste of time.

#### I know it won't change the world. I've quit several times

I'm determined to develop the character trait of finishing what i
start. If it flops, good. If it succeeds, also good.

## ENDGAME

This app hopes to bring you closer to real experiences. 

Don't sit behind a screen all your life, Get out there and do something. 
Find obscure gems, delightful sights and sounds and enjoyable experiences.
Meet people, and have stories to tell. I want people to share what
sights and sounds they are exploring and what it means to them.

_The World is always Beautiful. If you blink too long, you'll miss
it._
